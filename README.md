# Hello there 👋!

Here it's my portfolio's sources.

You can go to [here](https://benio-b.github.io) to see the result.

🚧 At the moment, the site is under construction. All pages are not created.

## Stack
This web site is build with [Vue 3](https://v3.vuejs.org/), [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
There is i18n with [Vue i18n](https://github.com/intlify/vue-i18n-next).

Of course, there is [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) to help me 😋!

And [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to test some dark part of the code 🧐.

## Here there are existing commands
### Run the project
```
npm install && npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Run your unit tests
```
npm run test:unit
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint:fix
npm run prettier
```

## Next features
In next time, I want:
- to use [Pa11y](https://pa11y.org/) to have an accessible site for more people.
- have more test
- what else?
